## Overview

The Stacks Node RPC API provides direct access to Stacks blockchain nodes through RPC endpoints. **Hiro proxies these calls to upstream Stacks nodes** - we don't maintain or control the nodes themselves, so performance and availability depend on upstream blockchain infrastructure.

## Key features

- **Raw blockchain node methods** - Submit transactions, call read-only contracts, query mempool/state
- **Real-time blockchain state** - No caching layers, direct node responses
- **Smart contract execution** - Execute read-only functions and retrieve contract state
- **Transaction broadcasting** - Submit transactions directly to the network

## Usage

```terminal
$ curl -L 'https://api.hiro.so/v2/info' -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

For more usage examples and rate limiting information, see [Usage](/apis/stacks-node-rpc-api/usage).

**REST vs RPC:** Use [Stacks Blockchain API](/apis/stacks-blockchain-api) for cached, indexed blockchain data (balances, transactions, events). Use RPC endpoints for raw node operations and real-time blockchain state queries.
